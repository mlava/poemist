Import a poem from the collection at PoetryDB, including the full poem text. Or, retrieve the poem-a-day from poets.org.

**New:**
- restored access to Poem-A-Day from poets.org

**Previously:**
- the Poemist API appears to be down, and therefore import from Poemist is no longer possible
- the Poem-A-Day appears to be down, and therefore import from Poem-A-Day is no longer possible
- now compatible with new Roam Research extension custom hotkeys

This extension can be triggered by:
1. open the Command Palette and select 'Random Poem from PoetryDB' or 'Poem-a-Day from Poets.org' 
2. using the SmartBlock command <%POETRYDB%> or <%POEMADAY%>
3. configuring a Roam Research Hotkey via Settings
